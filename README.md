# AVL-Tree

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. In such a tree, the difference between the heights of two 
child sub-trees of any node, i.e, balance factor should not be more than 1. If anytime this balance factor is 
more than 1, then re-balancing of the tree should be performed. The re-balancing of the tree is done by one or 
more tree rotations.
